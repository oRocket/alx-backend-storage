# 0x02. Redis basic

## exercise.py
Create a Cache class. In the __init__ method, store an instance of the Redis client as a private variable named _redis (using redis.Redis()) and flush the instance using flushdb.

Create a store method that takes a data argument and returns a string. The method should generate a random key (e.g. using uuid), store the input data in Redis using the random key and return the key.

Type-annotate store correctly. Remember that data can be a str, bytes, int or float.

## exercise.py
Redis only allows to store string, bytes and numbers (and lists thereof). Whatever you store as single elements, it will be returned as a byte string. Hence if you store "a" as a UTF-8 string, it will be returned as b"a" when retrieved from the server.

In this exercise we will create a get method that take a key string argument and an optional Callable argument named fn. This callable will be used to convert the data back to the desired format.

Remember to conserve the original Redis.get behavior if the key does not exist.

Also, implement 2 new methods: get_str and get_int that will automatically parametrize Cache.get with the correct conversion function.

The following code should not raise:

cache = Cache()

TEST_CASES = {
    b"foo": None,
    123: int,
    "bar": lambda d: d.decode("utf-8")
}

for value, fn in TEST_CASES.items():
    key = cache.store(value)
    assert cache.get(key, fn=fn) == value
